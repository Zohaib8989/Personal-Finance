# Personal Finance Dashboard Project

## Introduction

In this project, I used Google Sheets to store transactional data, linked to Power BI via the web connector. Utilizing Power Query, I cleaned and transformed the data, then modeled it with various date tables. I took daily conversion rates to convert transactions into the home currency (PKR). Using DAX, I created custom KPIs and developed insightful charts and graphs in Power BI to visualize multi-currency transactions. The final dashboard employs the scheduled refresh feature, ensuring users always see the most up-to-date information. This summary is part of the README file in the GitHub repository, showcasing my skills in data integration, modeling, and visualization.

### Problem Statement

- **Challenge:** Managing personal finances is challenging, especially with transactions in multiple currencies.
- **Data Issues:** Scattered data and complex currency conversion issues hinder clear and timely financial insights.
- **Traditional Tools:** Traditional tools fall short in providing real-time, actionable information.
- **Project Solution:**
  - Integrates, models, and visualizes financial data from Google Sheets in Power BI.
  - Converts all transactions into the home currency (PKR) for consistency.
  - Utilizes a dynamic dashboard with scheduled refreshes to offer real-time insights.

### Deliverables

- **Integrated Data Platform:** Google Sheets integrated with Power BI via web connector for seamless data flow.
- **Data Modeling:** Utilization of Power Query for cleaning and transforming raw transactional data.
- **Currency Conversion:** Implementation of daily conversion rates to unify transactions into PKR.
- **Dynamic Dashboard:** Creation of interactive charts and graphs in Power BI to visualize financial insights.
- **Scheduled Refresh:** Setup of scheduled refresh feature to ensure the dashboard reflects real-time data updates.

### Implementation Steps and Methodology

This section provides a detailed walkthrough of the project implementation, highlighting each step with screenshots and explanations of DAX formulas and measures used:

1. **Data Integration with Google Sheets and Power BI**
   - Utilized the web connector in Power BI to establish a connection with Google Sheets.
   - Screenshots demonstrating the setup and connection process.

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**
   - Applied Power Query to clean and transform raw transactional data from Google Sheets.
   - Screenshots illustrating the data cleaning steps and transformations performed.

3. **Data Modeling and Currency Conversion**
   - Created date tables and implemented DAX formulas for data modeling.
   - Some DAX formulas that I've used:
     - **YTD (Year-to-Date) Income:**
       ```dax
       YTD Income = CALCULATE(SUM(Transactions[Transaction Amount]), FILTER(Transactions, Transactions[Type] = "Getting"), DATESYTD(Transactions[Date]))
       ```
     - **Calculating Year-on-Year % change in cash balance**
       ```dax
        YOY Cash Î” = DIVIDE([Cash in hand] - [PY Cash], [PY Cash], 0)
       ```
     - **Total Expenses:**
       ```dax
       Total Expenses = SUMX(Transactions, Transactions[Amount] * Transactions[ExchangeRate])
       ```
     - **Account Balance Payoneer:**
       ```dax
        Payoneer 9089 Balance = 
        CALCULATE(
        // To calculate the Net Amount of Checking - Payoneer 9089
        CALCULATE(
        SUM(Transactions[Wallet Amount]),  -- Calculate the sum of Wallet Amounts
        FILTER(
            Transactions,  -- Filter the Transactions table
            Transactions[Account] = "Checking - Payoneer 9089"  -- Filter transactions where Account is "Checking - Payoneer 9089"
        )
        ),
        // Apply additional filters based on date criteria
        FILTER(
        ALLSELECTED('Calendar'[Date]),  -- Consider all selected dates in the Calendar table
        ISONORAFTER('Calendar'[Date], MAX('Calendar'[Date]), DESC)  -- Return dates equal to or after the latest selected date, descending
        ))
       ```
     - **Converting USD Balance into PKR:**
       ```dax
        Cum Balance USD in PKR = 
            // Calculate USD Balance in PKR by applying exchange rate at the latest dateUSD Balance in PKR = 
        CALCULATE(
        [Cum Balance USD],  // Calculate the USD Balance measure
        FILTER(
            ALLSELECTED('Transactions'[Date]),  // Consider all selected dates in the 'Transactions' table
            ISONORAFTER('Transactions'[Date], MAX('Transactions'[Date]), DESC)  // Filter dates that are on or after the maximum date in descending order
        )
        ) 
        * LOOKUPVALUE('USD/PKR'[Close], 'USD/PKR'[Date], MAX(Transactions[Date]))  // Multiply by the USD to PKR exchange rate on the latest date
       ```


4. **Dashboard Development**
   - Designed an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize financial insights.
   - Included screenshots of various charts, graphs, and KPIs created.

5. **Scheduled Refresh and Real-time Updates**
   - Configured scheduled refreshes in Power BI to ensure the dashboard reflects real-time data updates from Google Sheets.
   - Screenshots demonstrating the setup of scheduled refreshes and their impact on dashboard accuracy.

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the technical steps taken throughout the project, showcasing proficiency in data integration, modeling, visualization, and the strategic use of DAX formulas and measures for detailed financial analysis and reporting.
