# Personal Finance Dashboard Project

## Introduction

This project aims to create a comprehensive personal finance dashboard using Google Sheets, Python, and Power BI. The goal is to visualize financial transactions to gain better insights into personal spending habits and financial health. This README file outlines the problem statements, deliverables, and technical details, including the Python code used to link Google Sheets with Power BI and the DAX formulas implemented to create the desired visualizations.

## Problem Statements

1. **Data Consolidation**: Collecting and managing all personal finance transactions in a single, organized Google Sheet.
2. **Data Integration**: Automating the process of fetching data from Google Sheets and integrating it with Power BI for visualization.
3. **Visualization**: Creating interactive and insightful visualizations in Power BI to monitor income, expenses, savings, and investment trends.
4. **Insights Generation**: Utilizing DAX formulas to generate meaningful insights from the data.

## Deliverables

1. **Google Sheets Setup**: A well-structured Google Sheet for logging personal finance transactions.
2. **Python Script**: A Python script to link Google Sheets with Power BI.
3. **Power BI Dashboard**: An interactive dashboard in Power BI showcasing various financial metrics.
4. **DAX Formulas**: Custom DAX formulas to create calculated columns and measures for enhanced analysis.

## Python Code for Linking Google Sheets with Power BI

```python
import pandas as pd
import gspread
from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials

# Define the scope and credentials
scope = ["https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds", "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"]
creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name('path/to/your/credentials.json', scope)
client = gspread.authorize(creds)

# Open the Google Sheet
sheet = client.open("Your Google Sheet Name").sheet1

# Get all records from the sheet
data = sheet.get_all_records()

# Convert the data to a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Save the DataFrame to a CSV file for Power BI import
df.to_csv('personal_finance_data.csv', index=False)
```

## Power BI Dashboard

### DAX Formulas Used

Below are some of the DAX formulas used to create the calculated columns and measures in the Power BI dashboard:

1. **Total Income**
   ```DAX
   Total Income = SUM(Finance[Income])
   ```

2. **Total Expenses**
   ```DAX
   Total Expenses = SUM(Finance[Expenses])
   ```

3. **Net Savings**
   ```DAX
   Net Savings = [Total Income] - [Total Expenses]
   ```

4. **Monthly Average Income**
   ```DAX
   Monthly Average Income = AVERAGEX(SUMMARIZE(Finance, Finance[Month], "MonthlyIncome", [Total Income]), [MonthlyIncome])
   ```

5. **Monthly Average Expenses**
   ```DAX
   Monthly Average Expenses = AVERAGEX(SUMMARIZE(Finance, Finance[Month], "MonthlyExpenses", [Total Expenses]), [MonthlyExpenses])
   ```

6. **Expense Breakdown by Category**
   ```DAX
   Expense Breakdown = CALCULATE(SUM(Finance[Expenses]), ALLEXCEPT(Finance, Finance[Category]))
   ```
